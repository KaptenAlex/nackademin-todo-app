# nackademin-todo-app

This project contains a todo application with alot of unit tests and integration tests.
It also contains one of the most beautiful frontends the world will ever see.
(The sentence on line 4 is a joke and should not be taken seriously)

Just clone the repo and launch the application with "npm start" command in CLI
Then launch the frontend on localhost://8080 and login with the admin account. 
The credentials are:
username: "alex"
